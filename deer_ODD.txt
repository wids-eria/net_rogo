## WHAT IS IT?

(a general understanding of what the model is trying to show or explain)

## HOW IT WORKS

(what rules the agents use to create the overall behavior of the model)

DIURNAL VARIATION - 
 - tend to actively feed primarily around twilight, activity period extended during late summer
   - during feeding
     - move to areas of high food resource (generally open areas during the growing season, deciduous forest in early spring and winter)
     - response to other individuals depends on what type of habitat they are in (dispersed vs. clumped aggregation)
   - when not feeding
     - seek cover (thicker cover types, dense young(?) forest)
     - again, respond differently to other deer based on visibility of current cover type)


seasonal variation; 
 - preference for conifers in winter
 - rut
 - normal behavior in growing season

death - probabalistic
sex - 
eating

## HOW TO USE IT

## EXTENDING THE MODEL

(suggested things to add or change in the Code tab to make the model more complicated, detailed, accurate, etc.)

## NETLOGO FEATURES

View distance - the distance an individual agent is able to see is determined by the existing vegetation. In open habitats, the deer can see further, allowing them a larger search radius for food. In addition, there is a behavioral change in this habitat; given the increased viewing distance, individuals tend to aggregate, to utilize a collective lookout strategy of predator avoidance. In contrast, in the more dense habitat (forest) their view distance is restricted, and they avoid each other to adopt a different predator avoidance strategy.
