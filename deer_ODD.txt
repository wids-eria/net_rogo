## PURPOSE

The purpose of this model is to evaluate how populations of white-tailed deer (\textit{Odocoileus virginianus}) respond to various types of land use changes. Land use change can either be driven by player decisions in the Trails Forward video game, or prescribed based on user requirements.

## ENTITIES, STATE VARIABLES, AND SCALES

1) Male deer - Male deer are described using a number of state variables, which include their age, mate, destination target, energy level, their base metabolic rate, and their modified metabolic rate. Age is measured in days, and influences the mortality of individuals by imposing a maximum age, currently set at 15 years. Mate is the ID of any females they currently mate with; this variable is not stored, but used to permit them to copulate in the simulation. Destination target is the location they have evaluated as the highest suitability for their next move. Energy level is a generic measure of the caloric reserves available to an individual. This is intended to represent the typical caloric expenditure of a male deer over the course of a day, and can be replenished by eating. The energy reserves of a deer are decremented each day by the value of the modified metabolic rate. The modified metabolic rate is calculated as the base metabolic rate adjusted for seasonal variation. 

2) Female deer - In addition to those state variables tracked by the male deer, the female also tracks the variables offspring_lineage, reproductive_clock, reproductive_stage, estrous_cycle_length, and estrous_clock. Offspring lineage is an attempt to collect the id numbers of the deer's parents and previous ancestors by concatenating them into a single string. The reproductive_stage variable keeps track of the current stage of pregnancy in the individual, and is one of either in_estrous, di_metestrous, impregnated, gestation, parturition, lactation, or anestrous. The reproductive_clock variable keeps track of the developmental time of the current pregnancy, and is used to determine the timing of transitions between stages. The estrous_cycle_length determines the period of time the female is in estrus, before entering a non-receptive period of di_metestrus which lasts the same period of time. The estrous_clock variable is used to keep track of how long the deer has been in the current estrus cycle; the deer will go back and forth between in_estrus and di_metestrus during the rut until it either becomes impregnated and moves to the next reproductive stage, or the rut ends without impregnation, and the individual returns to an anestrous state until the following rut.

3) Food source

4) Seasons - The time of year plays an important role in dictating the behavior of deer in the simulation. This behavior can be collapsed into three primary phases, or seasons: 1) spring/summer - lasts from ordinal day 79 to 268, and generally represents the growing season when deer rely primarily on vegetative browse. 2) fall/winter - from ordinal day 269 to 78 (with an interruption by the rut), represents the non-growing season, where deer are reliant on hard browse and mast for sustenance, have reduced metabolism, and typically seek shelter from harsh environments (deer yards). 3) Rut - lasting from 269 to 309, this represents the reproductively active time of the year for the deer, when females become receptive, and males become highly active and prioritize reproduction above all other needs.

## PROCESS OVERVIEW AND SCHEDULING

(what rules the agents use to create the overall behavior of the model)

Deer have two primary modes; active and resting. Typically the active period of this diurnal cycle consists of moving and foraging, while resting consists of bedding down in locations which meet the thermal and cover needs of the individual. Specific behaviors during these two basic modes are further modified by the time of year, which is broken down into three primary seasons; spring/summer, rut, and fall/winter. The spring/summer season lasts from the first day of spring to the last day of summer, the rut lasts for four(?) weeks following the spring/summer season, and the fall/winter season lasts from the end of the rut to the first day of spring.

In the spring/summer season, deer rely primarily on herbaceous vegetation and young aspen for sustenance, which is reflected in the spring/summer habitat potential algorithm. During this period they roam widely, with females traveling approximately 2.5 km per day, and males up to 6.1 km per day. Their movement is predicated on what they perceive to be the best potential food source in the immediate area based on a number of features (ie. cover type and forest seral stage), but are not directly linked to the quantity of food source present at the location.

In the fall/winter season, deer rely more heavily on woody browse and mast from oaks and beech, reflected by the fall/winter habitat potential algorithm. This browse is less nutritious than that of the spring/summer season, and the weight of individuals can decrease even if this food source is relatively plentiful. A similar approach to assessing landscape features is used to determine movement. In addition, during this season the deer act in more of a central-place foraging mode, returning each night to 'deer yards', which offer reduced exposure to the elements. The selection of these areas reflected in the thermal cover potential algorithm.

During the rut, males travel further (up to ~7.4 km per day), primarily with the intention of impregnating as many females as possible during this time, and a lesser focus on eating. Females may enter estrus during this period, at which time they may become impregnated by a buck. Competition may occur for unimpregnated females in estrus, with the winner being determined as a function of individual health (as indicated by weight) and some measure of chance (see mate competition algorithm [not yet described])

Mortality of individuals at this point will be determined probabilistically as a function of the amount of time spent in different habitats (exposure), season, life stage (fawn/adult) and their energy budget.

Food resource will be modeled as a logistic growth function that changes as a function of the current day of year, and discounted according to either the spring/summer or fall/winter habitat potential rating.

### Potential distance view algorithm
Each individual movement action is determined by evaluating a number of paths from the current location to surrounding locations. The number and length of these paths is dependent on the visibility ranking of surrounding patches. The algorithm begins by evaluating the suitability and visibility of the first order neighborhood (surrounding nine cells). This first pass represents the set of possible paths with a distance of 1 cell. If the visibility of any of these 1st order paths terminates in a cell with visibility greater than 1, then a set of second order paths are also added to the array for consideration. These second order paths consist of the potential end locations immediately accessible from those cells in the immediate neighborhood with a distance value of > 1. This creates a set of possible paths with no more than 16 unique possible endpoints. The destination is set as that tile in the array of candidates with the highest suitability, and the individual is relocated to that position. If there is a tie between two or more tiles for the most suitable, one of those with the highest suitability score will be selected from random. Note: paths with a distance of two should incur double the time cost.

--OR--

A view distance is specified for each cover type, and is carried as a patch attribute. The radius in which a deer can perceive its surroundings is then determined by its immediate patch, irregardless of the qualities of the surrounding patches.

## NETLOGO FEATURES

View distance - the distance an individual agent is able to see is determined by the existing vegetation. In open habitats, the deer can see further, allowing them a larger search radius for food. In addition, there is a behavioral change in this habitat; given the increased viewing distance, individuals tend to aggregate, to utilize a collective lookout strategy of predator avoidance. In contrast, in the more dense habitat (forest) their view distance is restricted, and they avoid each other to adopt a different predator avoidance strategy.
